# Yvain, le chevalier au lion
Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, is a medieval romance by Chr√©tien de Troyes. This is a demo for a full game based off
this medieval romance. It is geared towards high intermediate to advanced-level French as a foreign language learners.

This is by far the largest project I've worked on in terms of sheer volume of code. I learned quite a bit while working
on it, and if I were to work on it again, I would probably redo almost everything.
